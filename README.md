# It is a list of files which tells don't add any of these files to our project when we do git commit
# The file is without any extension -> '.gitignore'

# After this we make a LICENSE file, which will be added coz we will upload our project to GIT
# This is added because 1. make it clear for other's that they can use it or not.
# 2. to protect ourselves, so that we don't get into copyright trouble.

# S-1 use command "git add ." -> to make these files ready for commit
# S-2 use command "git commit -am 'Message with commit'" -> this will add the files along with message given
